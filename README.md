# Landing-Page

This is the second project I've created since I started The Odin Project.

It was a tough one tho, but with research, perseverance, dedication and persistence I've been able to sail through succesfully.

I created this page section by section starting with the header section and in the header section, I started with the nav bar at the very top of the page, 

This project was meant for me to diplay my flexbox skills and I did. The approach was to first wright the HTML code the head on to the CSS file to style it up as instructed to me on The Odin Project.

Doing that made me progress fast in completing the project. After the nav bar, I headed on to the Hero Section. Then to the services and also to the part that has qoutes in them and also to the Call To Action Section and lastly to the footer section.

I picked the images from pixabay.com. A big thanks to them.I've really learnt a lot in this project. 

As I started the project, I was slow and was gradually increasing in pace towards the finish line which shows a positive sign.

I'm sorry to say, the buttons and links in this page leads no where, in due time I will attend to them.
